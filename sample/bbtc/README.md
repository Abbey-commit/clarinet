# BBTC

## Introduction

BBTC is a decentralized, trustless protocol aiming at bringing BTC on the Stacks chain.
In this protocol, we consider 2 parties:

Alice sends some BTC somewhere. The BTC is sealed and being kept by a multisig.
Participants of the multisig are sending some STX to a contract. If participants misbehave, they are being slashed, end and up losing their collateral + BTC yield.
